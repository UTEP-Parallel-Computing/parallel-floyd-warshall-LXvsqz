More so than any lab we have done, I ran into various problems that were very time consuming
to get. One big one was that i kept getting an out of bounds error. I don't exactly know why
though i came to the conclusion that it might have been because the matrix i was testing was
an m x n matrix instead of an n x n matrix. The pseudocode provided gave me great insight so
I did not have many issues with the algorithm itself. The report details do no discuss timing
so i did not list them in the report section. I did analyze them and saw a very small jump in
in the times for the better. This assignemnt took me about 5-6 hours to complete since i first
did the serial version and then tried the parallel version. I went about it this way since it
was the way that i was successful on the first two labs. One point i would like to touch on is
i believe this lab would be much more fun to do if we had more time to learn about the features
of MPI. I understand the reason we could not so i just thought i should mention it for future
reference. To run this program simpy run the file Warshall.py. The information displayed is the
input array followed by the array that goes through Warshalls algorithm.

Thanks for a great half semester David, I really did take away some valuable knowledge from this
class.
